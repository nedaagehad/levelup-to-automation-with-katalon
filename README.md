# ⬆️ Level up to Automation with Katalon:

This project serves as the applied hands-on practice for what I've learned from the [**Leveling up from a manual tester to an automation beginner (with Katalon Studio)**](https://academy.katalon.com/learning-path/fresher-automation-engineer/) learning path.
